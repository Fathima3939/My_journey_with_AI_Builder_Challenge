AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities.

### Keywords 

* __Machine learning__ - TMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.


- __Anomaly detection__ - A machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.

*In Microsoft Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.*


+ __Computer vision__ - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.


*An Example of computer- vision Seeing AI app (Designed for the blind and low vision community, the Seeing AI app harnesses the power of AI to open up the visual world and describe nearby people, text and objects.)*

*common computer vision tasks*
1. Image classification
2. Object detection
3. Semantic segmentation (For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors.)
4. Image analysis (extracts information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.)
5. Face detection, analysis, and recognition
6. Optical character recognition (OCR) -technique used to detect and read text in images. 

*Computer vision services in Microsoft Azure*
1. Computer Vision	You can use this service to analyze images and video, and extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
2. Custom Vision	Use this service to train custom image classification and object detection models using your own images.
3. Face	The Face service enables you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
4. Form Recognizer	Use this service to extract information from scanned forms and invoices.


+ __Natural language processing__ - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.

*For example, Starship Commander is a virtual reality (VR) game from Human Interact that takes place in a science fiction world. The game uses natural language processing to enable players to control the narrative and interact with in-game characters and starship systems.*



- __Knowledge mining__ - Knowledge mining is the term used to describe solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
*Example- Azure Cognitive Search is an AI-powered platform as a service (PaaS) that helps developers build rich search experiences for applications.*


- __Data scientists__  uses data to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.

### Six Principles of Responsibe AI
1. Fairness
2. Reliability and safety
3. Privacy and Security (Checks origin and path,if private or public data,data corruption consideration)
4. Inclusiveness
5. Transparency
6. Accountability
